- fc2c12e: Fix the per-session usage meter and add a near-context-limit warning (SPEC §7.9, issue #248)

  The composer's context/cost meter (`ConfigBar.svelte`, previously wired up for the model/mode/reasoning-effort bar) is SPEC §7.9's live usage meter — this doesn't add a second one, it fixes and extends the one already there. Three real bugs, all in `@loombox/providers-core`, none visible from `ConfigBar.svelte`'s own diff:

  - `AcpClient` was reading a raw `usage_update` wire event for field names (`tokensUsed`/`contextWindow`/`costUsd`) that don't exist on ACP's real shape. The protocol's actual `UsageUpdate` is `{used, size, cost}` with `cost: {amount, currency} | null` (agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/v1/schema) — so the meter never actually populated against a real ACP agent. Fixed in `client.ts`'s wire mapping; a non-USD `cost.currency` is left unconverted (`costUsd: undefined`) rather than mislabeled as dollars.
  - `cost.amount` is documented as the session's running cumulative total, not a per-update delta — the reducer was summing it, double-counting every update after the first. `cumulativeCostUsd` now tracks the latest reported total (`Math.max` against the previous value, guarding only against an out-of-order delivery ever making it visibly shrink).
  - A subagent tool call's `usage_update` reports its own, much smaller context window. The reducer now freezes the parent's `tokensUsed`/`contextWindow` across a subagent-attributed update instead of letting it overwrite them (previously masked by a UI-side guard, which just traded "the meter shows the wrong number" for "the meter shows nothing" while the subagent tool call was in flight) — the percentage no longer bounces either way. The subagent's cost is still folded into the cumulative figure, since ACP's own cumulative total already includes it.

  The subagent/parent split has no protocol support — ACP's `usage_update` carries no tool-call linkage at all — so it stays a documented client-side heuristic (`UsageRecord.attributedToSubagent`'s doc comment in `transcript.ts` spells out what it keys on and the two known ways it can misfire).

  New: a near-context-limit warning on the meter itself, at the newly-exported `CONTEXT_NEAR_LIMIT_THRESHOLD` (80%) — grounded against real-world auto-compaction thresholds observed on Claude Code (reported anywhere from ~80% to ~95% depending on source/version), so the warning fires before the earliest point any of them might silently compact. Carried to assistive tech via a `.sr-only` span (the meter's percentage track stays `aria-hidden`).

  Cost stays whatever the agent process itself reports via ACP's `cost.amount` — there is no per-token price table anywhere in this repo, and none is added here; a provider that omits `cost` simply doesn't move the cumulative figure for that update rather than getting an invented number.

  No aggregate spend-over-time view (issue #249) and no spend caps (issue #251) ship here — those build on `cumulativeCostUsd`, not the other way around. The broader attention-inbox surfacing of a near-limit session (issue #250) is separate too; this issue's own acceptance only asked for the warning on the meter itself.

### Patch Changes

- d09e12b: Stop a tool call with no `id` from wearing the "awaiting permission" outline

  `+page.svelte` computed `awaitingPermission={permissionHead?.toolCall.id === item.id}`. With no permission in flight, `permissionHead` is `undefined` and the optional chain short-circuits to `undefined`; if the transcript item's own `id` is also `undefined`, the comparison is `undefined === undefined`, true, and the row painted the amber `outline: 2px solid var(--color-warning)` even though nothing was pending. `item.id` is reachable as `undefined` from real traffic: the transcript payload is opaque ciphertext to the protocol, and the client casts the decrypted JSON with `openJson<AcpSessionWireEvent>` rather than parsing it with Zod, so nothing rejects a `tool_call` that omits `id`. The comparison now short-circuits on `permissionHead !== undefined` first.

  The same shape turned up twice more in a sweep of every optional-chain/possibly-undefined equality comparison across the web client and its shared protocol reducer. `RelayClient.discardStalePermissionForToolCall` compared `request.toolCall.id === event.id`; a malformed `tool_call_update` with no `id` could match a pending permission request whose own `toolCall.id` was equally malformed (the paired `permission_request` payload goes through the same unvalidated cast), cancelling it and publishing a false "resolved on another device" notice. `@loombox/providers-core`'s `reduceToolCall` looked up an existing transcript row by `item.id === update.id`; two unrelated malformed tool calls with no `id` would merge into a single row, the second silently overwriting the first's title/status. Both now refuse to match when the incoming `id` is `undefined`, so a malformed event always ends up in its own row/no-op rather than colliding with an earlier one.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 55161ed: Give `@loombox/providers-core` a browser-safe entry point (`@loombox/providers-core/browser`) and move `McpServerSecretMissingError` out of `client.ts` into `mcp-secret-grants.ts`, beside the logic that raises it. The barrel exports `AcpClient`/`PermissionQueue`/`ConfigOptionStore`, which extend Node's `EventEmitter`; `vite build` tree-shakes them away, but `vite dev` evaluates every module it serves, so the web app painted a healthy page and then died on hydration with `Cannot access "node:events.EventEmitter" in client code`. `apps/web` now imports the browser entry, and a test asserts nothing reachable from it imports a `node:` builtin.
- fcb76fc: Offer the agents a target can actually run, and fix what the forms ask. Nodes now probe each target's own PATH and announce which providers work there, so the agent picker is a real choice instead of a hardcoded one-option dropdown. Adds Codex and Oh My Pi as real providers alongside Claude Code. The new-session dialog leads with the starting prompt, no longer reshapes itself ten seconds after opening, and every form marks the one required field instead of labelling the four optional ones.
