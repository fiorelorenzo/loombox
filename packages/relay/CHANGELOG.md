### Minor Changes

- 535a2ee: Add the SPEC §7.26 connect/disconnect/pin wire protocol, relay routing, node handlers, and `RelayClient` API for connected accounts (issue #230)

  New `@loombox/protocol` message pairs: `github_connect_start_request`/`_cancel_request`/`_device_code`/`_result` (RFC 8628 device flow, issue #222), `jira_connect_request`/`_response` (API-token connect, issue #225), `connected_account_disconnect_request`/`_response`, and `account_pin_get/set/unset_request` + `account_pin_response` + `account_pin_resolve_request`/`_response` (per-project, per-capability pinning and hard-fail preview, issue #227). None of these ever carry a token, API key, or other secret — only metadata and routing fields.

  `packages/relay`: routes every one of the above directly by `nodeId`, scoped to the requester's account, through one consolidated `pendingAccountRequests` table (mirrors the existing `provision_target_request`/`ssh_discovery_request` pattern); a successful disconnect also forgets the account's synced metadata row (`ConnectedAccountStore.remove`, new on the store interface, in-memory and Postgres).

  `packages/node`: `NodeDaemon` now runs `GithubConnectService`/`JiraConnectService`/`AccountPinStore`/`account-pin.ts`'s resolvers against these messages — the device flow's user code streams back before the terminal result, a disconnect deletes the local keyring secret, and pin resolution surfaces `AccountPinRequiredError`/`AccountPinMalformedError`/`AccountHostMismatchError`/`AccountPinDanglingError`/`AmbiguousAccountError` as real, distinguishable response states.

  `apps/web`'s `RelayClient` gains a `connectedAccounts` reactive store (fed by the existing `connected_account_list` snapshot) plus `startGithubConnect`/`connectJiraAccount`/`disconnectAccount`/`getAccountPins`/`setAccountPin`/`unsetAccountPin`/`resolveAccountPin`/`refreshConnectedAccounts` — the write-path client API #230's UI is built against.

  **Scope note**: this change ships the wire protocol, relay routing, node handlers, and client API only. The Svelte UI itself (a Settings "Accounts" section, the device-flow/API-token connect forms, the per-project pin picker, and the disconnect confirmation) is tracked separately — see issue #230's own thread for the remaining UI work.

- 99e3583: Native tracker: kanban/list UI with custom type support (SPEC §7.10)

  Adds the client surface for loombox's own local tracker (`packages/shared`'s `NativeTrackerStore`, #210): a full-width Tracker page reachable from the left sidebar once a session is selected, with a kanban board and a priority-sorted/assignee-filtered list view, both driven entirely by `@loombox/protocol`'s new role-driven helpers (`resolveRoleValue`/`groupByWorkflowStatus`/`sortByPriority`/`filterByAssignee`) so a built-in Task/Bug/Epic and a project-defined custom type render identically — nothing in this feature branches on a record's `primaryType`.

  `@loombox/protocol` gets `tracker-records.ts`: the wire schema (`TrackerRecordV1`/`TrackerTypeDefinitionV1`) plus four new encrypted, session-scoped wire messages — `tracker_snapshot_request`/`_response` (read) and `tracker_write_request`/`_response` (create/update/defineType) — mirroring `fs.ts`'s existing pattern exactly. `@loombox/node` wires these into `NodeDaemon` against the same `NativeTrackerStore` a future MCP host will bind an agent's `tracker_*` tools to, so a human edit and an agent write land in the same on-disk file. `@loombox/relay` routes both pairs to/from the owning node exactly like `fs_list_request`/`_response`.

  The UI ships: empty state with a "New record" CTA, a retryable `ErrorNotice` (matching the Files panel's #582 "didn't answer in time" wording) for both a wire error and a client-owned bounded-wait timeout, and a loading state that always terminates. The kanban board answers issue #212's mobile requirement directly: at <=767px it renders one column at a time with Prev/Next controls instead of a horizontal scroll of narrow columns. Moving a card between columns has two paths — native HTML5 drag-and-drop for a desktop mouse, and a fully keyboard/touch-operable "Move to" `Select` on every card — both calling the same `RelayClient.updateTrackerRecord`, never local component state. A "New type" dialog lets a project define a custom type's `roles` mapping (which `fields` key holds title/status/priority/assignee), after which every generic surface renders it correctly with no code change.

- e05423a: Add per-project test/lint/build command configuration and auto-detection (SPEC §7.15, issue #245)

  A project's test/lint/build commands can now be read, saved, and auto-detected through the owning node: `TestRunnerConfigStore` (`@loombox/node`) persists them per project (mirrors `PermissionPolicyStore`'s JSON-file shape), and `detectTestRunnerCommands` proposes commands from `package.json`'s `scripts` block via whichever `ExecutionTarget` the project's session runs on (`local` or `ssh:`), picking `pnpm`/`yarn`/`npm` syntax off the project's lockfile. Detection only ever proposes a command for a script that genuinely exists — never a guessed default for a project with nothing detectable.

  Five new v1 wire messages (`test_runner_config_get`/`_set`/`_detect` client-to-node, `test_runner_config_result`/`_detected` node-to-client), routed/fanned out by the relay exactly like `fs_list_request`/`fs_list_response`, sealed under the session key so no command string ever reaches the relay in the clear. `RelayClient` gains `getTestRunnerConfig`/`setTestRunnerConfig`/`detectTestRunnerConfig`; `ProjectConfigPanel` gains a new "Test, lint & build" section (`TestRunnerConfigPanel`) with per-command explicit save and an "Auto-detect" action whose suggestions are shown for confirmation and never applied without an explicit Accept click.

  This ships the configuration half of SPEC §7.15's test runner (issue #245); the streaming execution half (issue #244, running the configured commands with live output and cancellation) is tracked separately.

- 635e20d: Add the streaming test/lint/build runner surface (SPEC §7.15, issue #244)

  Running a project's configured test/lint/build command (issue #245's config half) now streams live results from the cockpit instead of requiring a raw terminal. `packages/node/src/test-runner-process.ts` runs the command via `sh -c` on either target: locally with `child_process.spawn({ detached: true })`, so a cancel kills the whole process group (`process.kill(-pid, 'SIGKILL')`), not just the launcher; over `ssh:` it reuses the existing `RemoteProcessRunner` (setsid+fifo+log-tail) rather than opening a second channel, adding its own exit-code side-channel on top since that runner never captured one for a background job, and its cancel goes through `RemoteProcessRunner.stop()`, whose `setsid` branch now kills the whole remote process group (issue #642/#645). Both targets classify "command not found" as a uniform POSIX 127 instead of branching on ENOENT vs. remote shell text. `NodeDaemon` evaluates the project's permission policy (`evaluateCommandLine`, the same entry point `PolicyEnforcedPty`/`PolicyEnforcedExecutionTarget` use) before ever spawning, so a denied command surfaces as `could_not_start` with a policy reason and never runs.

  Five new v1 wire messages (`run_start`/`run_cancel` client-to-node, `run_started`/`run_output`/`run_exit` node-to-client), modeled on `terminal.ts`, routed/fanned out by the relay exactly like `terminal_open`/`terminal_output`, sealed under the session key so no command, output, or outcome ever reaches the relay in the clear. `RelayClient` gains `startRun`/`cancelRun`/`onRunOutput`/`runsFor`. The right sidebar's Files/Config sub-tabs gain a third "Runner" tab (`RunnerPanel.svelte`): one Run/Cancel action per configured command, its combined output streaming live (reusing the display-only `TerminalOutput` component), settling to a pass/fail/could-not-start state with the real exit code.

  Cancelling reaps the whole process tree on both targets, including forked grandchildren — verified with a `sleep 30 &`-forking fixture at the process, `NodeDaemon`, and (ssh) `RemoteProcessRunner` layers. Closing a node now also cancels every still-running local/ssh run instead of leaking it, the same way it already does for open terminals.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 5118b26: Add the `ConnectedAccount` data model and its relay metadata sync (SPEC §7.26)

  `@loombox/protocol` gets `v1/connected-accounts.ts`: the provider-agnostic `ConnectedAccount` type, Zod-validated and registered in `schemasV1` field-for-field per spec (`id`, `provider`, `host`, `providerAccountId`, `label`, `avatarUrl`, `credentialSource`, `scopes`, `capabilities`, `connectedAt`, `updatedAt`, `secretRef`). `id` is derived, never free-form: `composeConnectedAccountId`/`parseConnectedAccountId` round-trip `provider:host:providerAccountId`, tolerant of a colon-bearing `host` (a GitHub Enterprise Server or Jira Data Center instance on a non-default port). `providerAccountId` rejects anything shaped like an email address for every provider, and additionally requires a numeric value for `github` (GitHub's own `GET /user` id). There is deliberately no `nodePresence` field: which node holds a given account's secret locally is computed lazily at the point of use (issue #228), never synced.

  `@loombox/relay` wires the metadata row through its existing account-scoped sync path: a `ConnectedAccountStore` (in-memory and Postgres, new `connected_accounts` table), a node-only `connected_account_announce` message, and a client-only `connected_account_list_request`/`connected_account_list` pair, mirroring `target_announce`/`target_list_request` exactly. The synced row never carries a secret: `secretRef` only names a node-local OS-keyring entry (the same class of secret as SSH keys and MCP secrets), and the row is relay-readable plaintext by design, the same "account-scoped metadata" exception SPEC §8 already grants session existence and the device registry.

  No connect flow ships here (GitHub device grant, `gh` CLI import, PAT paste, Jira token, Jira 3LO are issues #222-#226), no management UI (#230), no per-project pinning (#227), no node-presence computation (#228, referenced above).

### Patch Changes

- bca2cd0: `/health` now checks Postgres and Redis before answering

  Previously `/health` was a plain liveness stub: `{"status":"ok"}` on every
  request, regardless of whether the relay's Postgres or Redis was actually
  reachable. It's now a real readiness probe (SPEC §7.21): a `SELECT 1`
  against Postgres and a `PING` against Redis (only when `REDIS_URL` is
  configured), each racing its own short timeout so a hung dependency 503s
  instead of hanging the request. 200 means both configured dependencies are
  reachable; a 503 body names which one failed, e.g.
  `{"status":"unhealthy","failed":["postgres"]}`. Still unauthenticated and
  exempt from the per-IP rate limit — an external uptime checker has no
  session and polls on its own schedule.

  See `docs/deploy-relay.md`'s new "Monitoring" section for pointing an
  external uptime service at this endpoint.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 10df3db: Let a resident node resolve its own account from the token it actually holds.

  A node that linked itself the intended way, through the device-authorization
  flow (it prints a short code, you approve it in the browser, it persists the
  token it mints), then died on startup with "authToken (LOOMBOX_AUTH_TOKEN) is
  not a valid, active Better Auth session". It was holding a token the relay
  accepted on the WebSocket handshake seconds later: the node asked Better Auth's
  `/api/auth/get-session`, which only knows browser sessions, while a device
  token lives in the relay's own `device_tokens`. The only way through was
  setting `LOOMBOX_ACCOUNT_ID` by hand, which defeats the point of the flow.

  The relay now answers the question itself, via `GET /account`, using the same
  `resolveAccountId` the WS handshake uses, so device tokens, Better Auth
  sessions and the no-Postgres dev stub all resolve identically. The node asks
  that endpoint, and falls back to the old Better Auth lookup only when a relay
  is too old to have the route, since self-hosters upgrade relay and node
  independently.

- 8f305d0: Survive a relay restart, follow the agent, and let a session be archived.

  A relay redeploy used to brick every node until someone restarted it by hand: a
  peer built on the WHATWG WebSocket cannot send a transport-level ping, so nodes
  and clients now probe liveness with a `ping`/`pong` pair the relay answers and
  advertises as a `heartbeat` capability, and both reconnect with backoff from a
  single handler wired to close _and_ error.

  The transcript now follows the agent's newest output instead of sitting pinned
  at the first frame, detaching when you scroll up to read.

  Sessions can be archived from the row menu, optionally taking their git
  worktree and branch with them, so a project stops accumulating one worktree per
  session that nobody would ever prune by hand.

### Patch Changes

- a7fe2c6: Pin the target-health fields through the relay's parse-and-forward. Zod strips keys its schema does not know, so a relay build older than the node's silently drops `loadPercent`, `hostname`, `platform` and `arch`, and the client shows an em dash for load and no machine identity at all. A stale production container did exactly that, with nothing anywhere reporting it.
- fcb76fc: Offer the agents a target can actually run, and fix what the forms ask. Nodes now probe each target's own PATH and announce which providers work there, so the agent picker is a real choice instead of a hardcoded one-option dropdown. Adds Codex and Oh My Pi as real providers alongside Claude Code. The new-session dialog leads with the starting prompt, no longer reshapes itself ten seconds after opening, and every form marks the one required field instead of labelling the four optional ones.
