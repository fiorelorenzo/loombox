### Patch Changes

- 35f3924: Tracker records are addressed by project, not by session, so a project's tracker
  is readable when no agent session is running for it. Adds a project resource key
  to the AMK key tree (`['project', accountId, projectPath]`), re-addresses the
  four tracker record messages to `nodeId` + `projectPath`, and makes the node
  answer every request it receives rather than dropping unanswerable ones.

### Minor Changes

- a1038bf: Dispatch the tracker bridge on a project's mode, closing #631's own last gap (SPEC §7.10, §7.26)

  The node now carries a connected-account registry of its own (`connected_account_list_request`, requested on every fresh relay connection alongside `amk_epoch_fetch_request`, mirroring how a client already does this on `attemptOpen()`), and the relay answers it for a node connection exactly like it already does for a client one — the "one open question" #631's plan left open, confirmed and closed.

  `NodeDaemon.readTrackerSnapshotForBridge`/`applyTrackerWriteForBridge` — previously the last unwired piece of #214/#215/#220, both merged and unreachable — now dispatch through one shared `resolveTrackerDispatch(projectPath, intent)` seam: `{kind:'native'}` behaves exactly as before (proven by the existing native tracker test suite passing untouched), `{kind:'live'}` resolves through `resolveTrackerBackend` and reaches the real `GithubTrackerBackend`/`JiraTrackerBackend`, and an unresolvable mode returns a typed error rather than ever falling back to the local native store. Reading and writing thread `intent:'read'`/`intent:'write'` through that one shared resolver — the only place the two bridge paths are allowed to differ — so they cannot resolve a project to two different tracker accounts.

  `tracker-live-bridge.ts` (new) maps a live `TrackerItemLive` into the native tracker's own `TrackerRecordV1`/`TrackerTypeDefinitionV1` wire shape (only `title`/`workflowStatus` roles are mapped — the two the board actually needs to render and categorize), so the kanban/list views and issue #651's workflow-category grouping need no live-specific rendering path at all.

  `trackerSnapshotErrorV1`/`trackerWriteErrorV1` gain an optional structured `reason: TrackerBackendResolutionErrorV1` (a wire mirror of `resolveTrackerBackend`'s own 10-member error union) alongside the existing plain `message` — checked against the existing shapes first per #631's own instruction, and widened only because a bare string cannot let a client switch on `kind`. The Tracker page's `.tracker-live-gap-note` (added by #672 to name this exact gap) is gone, replaced by a real connectivity-error state: `ErrorNotice` plus a reason-specific `Badge` (mirroring `AccountPinPicker.svelte`'s identical per-kind-badge convention).

  **Proven live now, end to end through a real relay with a stubbed GitHub API:** live-mode read (`list`) and write (`update`), read/write resolving to the identical account, and the `accountNotConnected`/`credentialUnavailable` error cases — including a read against a project with a real, on-disk native record, proving the failure never falls back to it. **Still fixture-only:** Jira live coverage beyond `resolveTrackerBackend`'s own suite, `create`/`transition`/board-drag write-back (Jira transition discovery and GitHub's state-field translation are slice-2 work, not this issue's scope), and pagination past a live snapshot's first page (the bridge's wire schema carries no cursor).

### Patch Changes

- cce97a8: Move a project's tracker mode from browser `localStorage` to the node (SPEC §7.10, issue #631)

  `TrackerMode` used to be persisted only in the browser's `localStorage`, so a project switched to `live` GitHub or Jira tracking saved that choice per BROWSER, not per project, and the node had no way to see it at all — `NodeDaemon.readTrackerSnapshotForBridge` read the local native tracker store unconditionally because it was the only thing the node had, so a switched project silently kept showing local records.

  `@loombox/node` gets `TrackerModeStore` (`tracker-mode-store.ts`), the exact sibling of `AccountPinStore`: one JSON file under `stateDir`, keyed by a project's absolute `projectPath`, re-validated on every read through `@loombox/protocol`'s `safeParseTrackerMode` — an on-disk value that no longer validates reads back as absent, never repaired into a guessed `{kind:'native'}`. `NodeDaemon` gains `tracker_mode_get_request`/`tracker_mode_set_request` handlers replying with `tracker_mode_response`, mirroring the account-pin request/reply convention exactly, plus a synchronous `this.trackerModeStore.get(projectPath)` read for other daemon code (the bridge dispatch consumes this next).

  `@loombox/relay` gets `tracker_mode_get/set_request`/`tracker_mode_response` added to its existing client↔node routing switch (reusing the account-pin request table) — the protocol schemas alone don't make a message reach anywhere without this.

  `apps/web`'s `tracker-mode-store.ts` gets `createRelayTrackerModeStorage`, now what `TrackerPage.svelte` actually constructs: relay-backed, with a real three-state `Readable<TrackerModeState>` (`'loading'`/`'loaded'`/`'error'`) so a saved mode can never flash the "choose a mode" setup step while its own node round trip is still in flight — collapsing "I don't know yet" into "never chosen" would reintroduce the exact guess issue #209 exists to prevent, one layer up. `TrackerConfigPanel.svelte`'s existing synchronous `TrackerModeStorage` (`get`/`set`) contract is unchanged and untouched.

  **Migration, one-shot, node always wins**: on first load, a mode already saved in `localStorage` from before this change is pushed to the node (`tracker_mode_set_request`) and the local key is cleared — but only if the node had nothing saved; a mode the node already has always wins outright, and a failed push leaves the local key alone so a later retry can still migrate it. A project with no mode saved anywhere still reaches the exact same "choose native or live" setup step as before, once loading settles — the choice now lives on the node and is visible from any device.

  The bridge dispatch (`readTrackerSnapshotForBridge`/`applyTrackerWriteForBridge` actually consulting this mode, via `@loombox/node`'s `resolveTrackerBackend`) and the Tracker page's richer connectivity-error rendering are follow-up work on top of this transport.

### Minor Changes

- 535a2ee: Add the SPEC §7.26 connect/disconnect/pin wire protocol, relay routing, node handlers, and `RelayClient` API for connected accounts (issue #230)

  New `@loombox/protocol` message pairs: `github_connect_start_request`/`_cancel_request`/`_device_code`/`_result` (RFC 8628 device flow, issue #222), `jira_connect_request`/`_response` (API-token connect, issue #225), `connected_account_disconnect_request`/`_response`, and `account_pin_get/set/unset_request` + `account_pin_response` + `account_pin_resolve_request`/`_response` (per-project, per-capability pinning and hard-fail preview, issue #227). None of these ever carry a token, API key, or other secret — only metadata and routing fields.

  `packages/relay`: routes every one of the above directly by `nodeId`, scoped to the requester's account, through one consolidated `pendingAccountRequests` table (mirrors the existing `provision_target_request`/`ssh_discovery_request` pattern); a successful disconnect also forgets the account's synced metadata row (`ConnectedAccountStore.remove`, new on the store interface, in-memory and Postgres).

  `packages/node`: `NodeDaemon` now runs `GithubConnectService`/`JiraConnectService`/`AccountPinStore`/`account-pin.ts`'s resolvers against these messages — the device flow's user code streams back before the terminal result, a disconnect deletes the local keyring secret, and pin resolution surfaces `AccountPinRequiredError`/`AccountPinMalformedError`/`AccountHostMismatchError`/`AccountPinDanglingError`/`AmbiguousAccountError` as real, distinguishable response states.

  `apps/web`'s `RelayClient` gains a `connectedAccounts` reactive store (fed by the existing `connected_account_list` snapshot) plus `startGithubConnect`/`connectJiraAccount`/`disconnectAccount`/`getAccountPins`/`setAccountPin`/`unsetAccountPin`/`resolveAccountPin`/`refreshConnectedAccounts` — the write-path client API #230's UI is built against.

  **Scope note**: this change ships the wire protocol, relay routing, node handlers, and client API only. The Svelte UI itself (a Settings "Accounts" section, the device-flow/API-token connect forms, the per-project pin picker, and the disconnect confirmation) is tracked separately — see issue #230's own thread for the remaining UI work.

- 99e3583: Native tracker: kanban/list UI with custom type support (SPEC §7.10)

  Adds the client surface for loombox's own local tracker (`packages/shared`'s `NativeTrackerStore`, #210): a full-width Tracker page reachable from the left sidebar once a session is selected, with a kanban board and a priority-sorted/assignee-filtered list view, both driven entirely by `@loombox/protocol`'s new role-driven helpers (`resolveRoleValue`/`groupByWorkflowStatus`/`sortByPriority`/`filterByAssignee`) so a built-in Task/Bug/Epic and a project-defined custom type render identically — nothing in this feature branches on a record's `primaryType`.

  `@loombox/protocol` gets `tracker-records.ts`: the wire schema (`TrackerRecordV1`/`TrackerTypeDefinitionV1`) plus four new encrypted, session-scoped wire messages — `tracker_snapshot_request`/`_response` (read) and `tracker_write_request`/`_response` (create/update/defineType) — mirroring `fs.ts`'s existing pattern exactly. `@loombox/node` wires these into `NodeDaemon` against the same `NativeTrackerStore` a future MCP host will bind an agent's `tracker_*` tools to, so a human edit and an agent write land in the same on-disk file. `@loombox/relay` routes both pairs to/from the owning node exactly like `fs_list_request`/`_response`.

  The UI ships: empty state with a "New record" CTA, a retryable `ErrorNotice` (matching the Files panel's #582 "didn't answer in time" wording) for both a wire error and a client-owned bounded-wait timeout, and a loading state that always terminates. The kanban board answers issue #212's mobile requirement directly: at <=767px it renders one column at a time with Prev/Next controls instead of a horizontal scroll of narrow columns. Moving a card between columns has two paths — native HTML5 drag-and-drop for a desktop mouse, and a fully keyboard/touch-operable "Move to" `Select` on every card — both calling the same `RelayClient.updateTrackerRecord`, never local component state. A "New type" dialog lets a project define a custom type's `roles` mapping (which `fields` key holds title/status/priority/assignee), after which every generic surface renders it correctly with no code change.

- e05423a: Add per-project test/lint/build command configuration and auto-detection (SPEC §7.15, issue #245)

  A project's test/lint/build commands can now be read, saved, and auto-detected through the owning node: `TestRunnerConfigStore` (`@loombox/node`) persists them per project (mirrors `PermissionPolicyStore`'s JSON-file shape), and `detectTestRunnerCommands` proposes commands from `package.json`'s `scripts` block via whichever `ExecutionTarget` the project's session runs on (`local` or `ssh:`), picking `pnpm`/`yarn`/`npm` syntax off the project's lockfile. Detection only ever proposes a command for a script that genuinely exists — never a guessed default for a project with nothing detectable.

  Five new v1 wire messages (`test_runner_config_get`/`_set`/`_detect` client-to-node, `test_runner_config_result`/`_detected` node-to-client), routed/fanned out by the relay exactly like `fs_list_request`/`fs_list_response`, sealed under the session key so no command string ever reaches the relay in the clear. `RelayClient` gains `getTestRunnerConfig`/`setTestRunnerConfig`/`detectTestRunnerConfig`; `ProjectConfigPanel` gains a new "Test, lint & build" section (`TestRunnerConfigPanel`) with per-command explicit save and an "Auto-detect" action whose suggestions are shown for confirmation and never applied without an explicit Accept click.

  This ships the configuration half of SPEC §7.15's test runner (issue #245); the streaming execution half (issue #244, running the configured commands with live output and cancellation) is tracked separately.

- 635e20d: Add the streaming test/lint/build runner surface (SPEC §7.15, issue #244)

  Running a project's configured test/lint/build command (issue #245's config half) now streams live results from the cockpit instead of requiring a raw terminal. `packages/node/src/test-runner-process.ts` runs the command via `sh -c` on either target: locally with `child_process.spawn({ detached: true })`, so a cancel kills the whole process group (`process.kill(-pid, 'SIGKILL')`), not just the launcher; over `ssh:` it reuses the existing `RemoteProcessRunner` (setsid+fifo+log-tail) rather than opening a second channel, adding its own exit-code side-channel on top since that runner never captured one for a background job, and its cancel goes through `RemoteProcessRunner.stop()`, whose `setsid` branch now kills the whole remote process group (issue #642/#645). Both targets classify "command not found" as a uniform POSIX 127 instead of branching on ENOENT vs. remote shell text. `NodeDaemon` evaluates the project's permission policy (`evaluateCommandLine`, the same entry point `PolicyEnforcedPty`/`PolicyEnforcedExecutionTarget` use) before ever spawning, so a denied command surfaces as `could_not_start` with a policy reason and never runs.

  Five new v1 wire messages (`run_start`/`run_cancel` client-to-node, `run_started`/`run_output`/`run_exit` node-to-client), modeled on `terminal.ts`, routed/fanned out by the relay exactly like `terminal_open`/`terminal_output`, sealed under the session key so no command, output, or outcome ever reaches the relay in the clear. `RelayClient` gains `startRun`/`cancelRun`/`onRunOutput`/`runsFor`. The right sidebar's Files/Config sub-tabs gain a third "Runner" tab (`RunnerPanel.svelte`): one Run/Cancel action per configured command, its combined output streaming live (reusing the display-only `TerminalOutput` component), settling to a pass/fail/could-not-start state with the real exit code.

  Cancelling reaps the whole process tree on both targets, including forked grandchildren — verified with a `sleep 30 &`-forking fixture at the process, `NodeDaemon`, and (ssh) `RemoteProcessRunner` layers. Closing a node now also cancels every still-running local/ssh run instead of leaking it, the same way it already does for open terminals.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 5118b26: Add the `ConnectedAccount` data model and its relay metadata sync (SPEC §7.26)

  `@loombox/protocol` gets `v1/connected-accounts.ts`: the provider-agnostic `ConnectedAccount` type, Zod-validated and registered in `schemasV1` field-for-field per spec (`id`, `provider`, `host`, `providerAccountId`, `label`, `avatarUrl`, `credentialSource`, `scopes`, `capabilities`, `connectedAt`, `updatedAt`, `secretRef`). `id` is derived, never free-form: `composeConnectedAccountId`/`parseConnectedAccountId` round-trip `provider:host:providerAccountId`, tolerant of a colon-bearing `host` (a GitHub Enterprise Server or Jira Data Center instance on a non-default port). `providerAccountId` rejects anything shaped like an email address for every provider, and additionally requires a numeric value for `github` (GitHub's own `GET /user` id). There is deliberately no `nodePresence` field: which node holds a given account's secret locally is computed lazily at the point of use (issue #228), never synced.

  `@loombox/relay` wires the metadata row through its existing account-scoped sync path: a `ConnectedAccountStore` (in-memory and Postgres, new `connected_accounts` table), a node-only `connected_account_announce` message, and a client-only `connected_account_list_request`/`connected_account_list` pair, mirroring `target_announce`/`target_list_request` exactly. The synced row never carries a secret: `secretRef` only names a node-local OS-keyring entry (the same class of secret as SSH keys and MCP secrets), and the row is relay-readable plaintext by design, the same "account-scoped metadata" exception SPEC §8 already grants session existence and the device registry.

  No connect flow ships here (GitHub device grant, `gh` CLI import, PAT paste, Jira token, Jira 3LO are issues #222-#226), no management UI (#230), no per-project pinning (#227), no node-presence computation (#228, referenced above).

### Patch Changes

- bca2cd0: `/health` now checks Postgres and Redis before answering

  Previously `/health` was a plain liveness stub: `{"status":"ok"}` on every
  request, regardless of whether the relay's Postgres or Redis was actually
  reachable. It's now a real readiness probe (SPEC §7.21): a `SELECT 1`
  against Postgres and a `PING` against Redis (only when `REDIS_URL` is
  configured), each racing its own short timeout so a hung dependency 503s
  instead of hanging the request. 200 means both configured dependencies are
  reachable; a 503 body names which one failed, e.g.
  `{"status":"unhealthy","failed":["postgres"]}`. Still unauthenticated and
  exempt from the per-IP rate limit — an external uptime checker has no
  session and polls on its own schedule.

  See `docs/deploy-relay.md`'s new "Monitoring" section for pointing an
  external uptime service at this endpoint.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 10df3db: Let a resident node resolve its own account from the token it actually holds.

  A node that linked itself the intended way, through the device-authorization
  flow (it prints a short code, you approve it in the browser, it persists the
  token it mints), then died on startup with "authToken (LOOMBOX_AUTH_TOKEN) is
  not a valid, active Better Auth session". It was holding a token the relay
  accepted on the WebSocket handshake seconds later: the node asked Better Auth's
  `/api/auth/get-session`, which only knows browser sessions, while a device
  token lives in the relay's own `device_tokens`. The only way through was
  setting `LOOMBOX_ACCOUNT_ID` by hand, which defeats the point of the flow.

  The relay now answers the question itself, via `GET /account`, using the same
  `resolveAccountId` the WS handshake uses, so device tokens, Better Auth
  sessions and the no-Postgres dev stub all resolve identically. The node asks
  that endpoint, and falls back to the old Better Auth lookup only when a relay
  is too old to have the route, since self-hosters upgrade relay and node
  independently.

- 8f305d0: Survive a relay restart, follow the agent, and let a session be archived.

  A relay redeploy used to brick every node until someone restarted it by hand: a
  peer built on the WHATWG WebSocket cannot send a transport-level ping, so nodes
  and clients now probe liveness with a `ping`/`pong` pair the relay answers and
  advertises as a `heartbeat` capability, and both reconnect with backoff from a
  single handler wired to close _and_ error.

  The transcript now follows the agent's newest output instead of sitting pinned
  at the first frame, detaching when you scroll up to read.

  Sessions can be archived from the row menu, optionally taking their git
  worktree and branch with them, so a project stops accumulating one worktree per
  session that nobody would ever prune by hand.

### Patch Changes

- a7fe2c6: Pin the target-health fields through the relay's parse-and-forward. Zod strips keys its schema does not know, so a relay build older than the node's silently drops `loadPercent`, `hostname`, `platform` and `arch`, and the client shows an em dash for load and no machine identity at all. A stale production container did exactly that, with nothing anywhere reporting it.
- fcb76fc: Offer the agents a target can actually run, and fix what the forms ask. Nodes now probe each target's own PATH and announce which providers work there, so the agent picker is a real choice instead of a hardcoded one-option dropdown. Adds Codex and Oh My Pi as real providers alongside Claude Code. The new-session dialog leads with the starting prompt, no longer reshapes itself ten seconds after opening, and every form marks the one required field instead of labelling the four optional ones.
