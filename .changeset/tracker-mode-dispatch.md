Dispatch the tracker bridge on a project's mode, closing #631's own last gap (SPEC §7.10, §7.26)

The node now carries a connected-account registry of its own (`connected_account_list_request`, requested on every fresh relay connection alongside `amk_epoch_fetch_request`, mirroring how a client already does this on `attemptOpen()`), and the relay answers it for a node connection exactly like it already does for a client one — the "one open question" #631's plan left open, confirmed and closed.

`NodeDaemon.readTrackerSnapshotForBridge`/`applyTrackerWriteForBridge` — previously the last unwired piece of #214/#215/#220, both merged and unreachable — now dispatch through one shared `resolveTrackerDispatch(projectPath, intent)` seam: `{kind:'native'}` behaves exactly as before (proven by the existing native tracker test suite passing untouched), `{kind:'live'}` resolves through `resolveTrackerBackend` and reaches the real `GithubTrackerBackend`/`JiraTrackerBackend`, and an unresolvable mode returns a typed error rather than ever falling back to the local native store. Reading and writing thread `intent:'read'`/`intent:'write'` through that one shared resolver — the only place the two bridge paths are allowed to differ — so they cannot resolve a project to two different tracker accounts.

`tracker-live-bridge.ts` (new) maps a live `TrackerItemLive` into the native tracker's own `TrackerRecordV1`/`TrackerTypeDefinitionV1` wire shape (only `title`/`workflowStatus` roles are mapped — the two the board actually needs to render and categorize), so the kanban/list views and issue #651's workflow-category grouping need no live-specific rendering path at all.

`trackerSnapshotErrorV1`/`trackerWriteErrorV1` gain an optional structured `reason: TrackerBackendResolutionErrorV1` (a wire mirror of `resolveTrackerBackend`'s own 10-member error union) alongside the existing plain `message` — checked against the existing shapes first per #631's own instruction, and widened only because a bare string cannot let a client switch on `kind`. The Tracker page's `.tracker-live-gap-note` (added by #672 to name this exact gap) is gone, replaced by a real connectivity-error state: `ErrorNotice` plus a reason-specific `Badge` (mirroring `AccountPinPicker.svelte`'s identical per-kind-badge convention).

**Proven live now, end to end through a real relay with a stubbed GitHub API:** live-mode read (`list`) and write (`update`), read/write resolving to the identical account, and the `accountNotConnected`/`credentialUnavailable` error cases — including a read against a project with a real, on-disk native record, proving the failure never falls back to it. **Still fixture-only:** Jira live coverage beyond `resolveTrackerBackend`'s own suite, `create`/`transition`/board-drag write-back (Jira transition discovery and GitHub's state-field translation are slice-2 work, not this issue's scope), and pagination past a live snapshot's first page (the bridge's wire schema carries no cursor).
