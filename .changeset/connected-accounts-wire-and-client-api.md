Add the SPEC §7.26 connect/disconnect/pin wire protocol, relay routing, node handlers, and `RelayClient` API for connected accounts (issue #230)

New `@loombox/protocol` message pairs: `github_connect_start_request`/`_cancel_request`/`_device_code`/`_result` (RFC 8628 device flow, issue #222), `jira_connect_request`/`_response` (API-token connect, issue #225), `connected_account_disconnect_request`/`_response`, and `account_pin_get/set/unset_request` + `account_pin_response` + `account_pin_resolve_request`/`_response` (per-project, per-capability pinning and hard-fail preview, issue #227). None of these ever carry a token, API key, or other secret — only metadata and routing fields.

`packages/relay`: routes every one of the above directly by `nodeId`, scoped to the requester's account, through one consolidated `pendingAccountRequests` table (mirrors the existing `provision_target_request`/`ssh_discovery_request` pattern); a successful disconnect also forgets the account's synced metadata row (`ConnectedAccountStore.remove`, new on the store interface, in-memory and Postgres).

`packages/node`: `NodeDaemon` now runs `GithubConnectService`/`JiraConnectService`/`AccountPinStore`/`account-pin.ts`'s resolvers against these messages — the device flow's user code streams back before the terminal result, a disconnect deletes the local keyring secret, and pin resolution surfaces `AccountPinRequiredError`/`AccountPinMalformedError`/`AccountHostMismatchError`/`AccountPinDanglingError`/`AmbiguousAccountError` as real, distinguishable response states.

`apps/web`'s `RelayClient` gains a `connectedAccounts` reactive store (fed by the existing `connected_account_list` snapshot) plus `startGithubConnect`/`connectJiraAccount`/`disconnectAccount`/`getAccountPins`/`setAccountPin`/`unsetAccountPin`/`resolveAccountPin`/`refreshConnectedAccounts` — the write-path client API #230's UI is built against.

**Scope note**: this change ships the wire protocol, relay routing, node handlers, and client API only. The Svelte UI itself (a Settings "Accounts" section, the device-flow/API-token connect forms, the per-project pin picker, and the disconnect confirmation) is tracked separately — see issue #230's own thread for the remaining UI work.
