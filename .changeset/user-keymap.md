A full user keymap, remappable and synced per account (Zed-parity F3-3, issue #760, building on the action registry #758 and default binding set #759).

Every registered action is remappable from Settings → Keyboard. Storage: a new account-scoped `keymaps` table on the relay (`keymap_get_request`/`keymap_set_request`/`keymap_result`), sealed under `@loombox/crypto`'s new `deriveKeymapKey` (`['keymap', accountId]`, no session or project involved at all — a keymap edit works with zero nodes online). Fetched proactively on every fresh connection, so a remap survives a new device sign-in from first paint; saved live to `RelayClient.keymap`, which `action-registry.ts`'s `effectiveShortcut`/`matchShortcut` now accept as an `overrides` param, so a remap takes effect without a reload everywhere the registry is read — the palette, the keyboard dispatcher, and `CanvasZeroState`.

The two questions the decision required answering, not glossing over:

1. **The phone.** The Keyboard settings section never renders on a narrow viewport (`SettingsPage.svelte`, gated on `viewport.ts`'s `isNarrowViewport`) — recording a chord has nothing to attach to with no physical keyboard to press. The resolved bindings still apply globally regardless of viewport (harmless with no keyboard, useful with a paired one).
2. **Per-device availability.** The keymap stays a single per-account record with no per-device field. `$lib/keymap.ts`'s `isChordUnavailableHere` computes a runtime "unavailable here" state instead, generalizing issue #759's own browser-reserved-chord rule (`Mod+N`, `Mod+Alt+Right`/`Left`) to any user-remapped chord that lands on one of those reservations — a binding reserved on this device still saves and still works on another.

An invalid or conflicting candidate (unknown action id, malformed chord, two actions sharing a chord) is rejected client-side by `$lib/keymap.ts`'s `validateKeymapCandidate`, naming the offending entry, before it is ever sent — the previously saved keymap is never touched. Two tabs on the same account: last full write wins at the relay, and every other open connection on that account is pushed the winning state live (not just the requester), so a losing tab corrects itself instead of drifting stale.
