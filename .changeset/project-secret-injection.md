Per-project scoped secret/env injection for agent execution (issue #258): a project can declare env vars its spawned agent process gets at start, each either a literal value or a reference to a node-local secret by name — resolved and injected only on the executing node, never sent to the relay or a client.

- `@loombox/providers-core`'s `project-env.ts` mirrors `mcp-secret-grants.ts` (issue #189): `ProjectEnvVarDecl`, a per-secret `ProjectEnvGrantStore` (deliberately separate from `McpSecretGrantStore` — direct agent-env injection is a distinct trust boundary from an MCP server grant), and `resolveProjectEnv`, which fails fast on an ungranted/missing secret before returning anything.
- `@loombox/protocol`'s `sessionPrivateMetaV1.projectEnvDecls` carries a client's declared list inside the same encrypted envelope as `title`/`projectPath`/`mcpServerConfigs`.
- `@loombox/node`'s `NodeProjectEnvManager` persists only the grant ACL and reuses `NodeMcpSecretManager`'s existing keyring-backed secret-value storage rather than a second store, so a secret set once is usable by both an MCP server grant and direct env injection. `NodeDaemon` resolves it alongside `mcpServers` at session start, in the same before-any-worktree preflight path that already fails clearly on a bad MCP grant — a missing/ungranted secret now gets the identical treatment (a minimal `session_announce` plus `session_status: 'error'` naming the env var and secret). `ssh:` targets refuse a declared env var outright for now (the sandboxing dependency, issue #257, is still open) rather than silently starting an agent missing it.
- `@loombox/supervisor`'s `AgentSupervisor.start()` gains an `env` option, merged into the provider's own `spawnConfig.env` before spawning — never sent anywhere but the local `child_process.spawn()` call.
- `@loombox/web` gets `project-env-store.ts` (client-side declaration CRUD, mirrors `mcp-server-store.ts`) and `ProjectSecretsPanel.svelte`, mounted in the Config panel next to MCP servers; `RelayClient.createSession()` and `NewSessionDialog` forward the declared list on every session creation, the same way `mcpServerConfigs` does.
