'@loombox/providers-core': minor
'@loombox/web': patch

Give `@loombox/providers-core` a browser-safe entry point (`@loombox/providers-core/browser`) and move `McpServerSecretMissingError` out of `client.ts` into `mcp-secret-grants.ts`, beside the logic that raises it. The barrel exports `AcpClient`/`PermissionQueue`/`ConfigOptionStore`, which extend Node's `EventEmitter`; `vite build` tree-shakes them away, but `vite dev` evaluates every module it serves, so the web app painted a healthy page and then died on hydration with `Cannot access "node:events.EventEmitter" in client code`. `apps/web` now imports the browser entry, and a test asserts nothing reachable from it imports a `node:` builtin.
