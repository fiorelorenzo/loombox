### Minor Changes

- c0d6291: Make projects real, and give the cockpit one navigation instead of two.

  `Project` is now a first-class thing in the client rather than a `projectPath` string buried in each session's encrypted envelope, so you pick a folder once and spawn sessions into it. Sessions are listed in a tree under their project, and Inbox, Nodes and Settings became pages in the main area instead of drawer tabs that the sidebar also linked to. The drawer keeps only what belongs to the open session: Files, Terminal, Config.

  On the wire, a session's private envelope gains an optional `worktree` field, which is SPEC 7.1's per-session isolate-or-work-in-place choice finally reaching the client, and the target fs listing gains an optional `gitRepo` flag so the picker knows whether to offer it. Both are additive, so a node or client older than its peer keeps parsing. The node also stops requiring a git repository for in-place sessions, which SPEC 6 has always said it should support.

- c86aa72: Survive a node restart, bound the agent spawn, and make the surface coherent

  A node restart no longer forgets every session it owns, so rows stop pointing at sessions nobody tracks and worktrees stop leaking. The agent spawn is bounded, and a session is announced as soon as its worktree exists rather than only once the agent is up.

  The node status numbers were wrong: CPU was a load average mislabelled as utilisation, and RAM counted reclaimable page cache as used. Both fixed, and the reading now carries the machine's hostname, platform and arch so a target called "Local" says which machine it is.

  On the client: one page title instead of two, one Settings entry instead of three, a real form language instead of eight copies of the same hand-rolled input, dense node rows instead of three progress bars, and a transcript that states who is speaking with a composer that is part of it rather than a chat box bolted underneath.

- edf90ad: Say something true when a new session times out: the node cuts the worktree before the agent is up and only announces afterwards, so a timeout there is not evidence the session failed. The dialog no longer shows the raw wire identifier, and no longer claims it did not happen.
- 8f305d0: Survive a relay restart, follow the agent, and let a session be archived.

  A relay redeploy used to brick every node until someone restarted it by hand: a
  peer built on the WHATWG WebSocket cannot send a transport-level ping, so nodes
  and clients now probe liveness with a `ping`/`pong` pair the relay answers and
  advertises as a `heartbeat` capability, and both reconnect with backoff from a
  single handler wired to close _and_ error.

  The transcript now follows the agent's newest output instead of sitting pinned
  at the first frame, detaching when you scroll up to read.

  Sessions can be archived from the row menu, optionally taking their git
  worktree and branch with them, so a project stops accumulating one worktree per
  session that nobody would ever prune by hand.

- fcb76fc: Offer the agents a target can actually run, and fix what the forms ask. Nodes now probe each target's own PATH and announce which providers work there, so the agent picker is a real choice instead of a hardcoded one-option dropdown. Adds Codex and Oh My Pi as real providers alongside Claude Code. The new-session dialog leads with the starting prompt, no longer reshapes itself ten seconds after opening, and every form marks the one required field instead of labelling the four optional ones.

### Patch Changes

- 60378d7: One `<h1>` per view, naming the view rather than the app. The sidebar wordmark was a heading too, so every screen carried two and one of them was always wrong: the app's name never changes, so it cannot be the heading of what you are looking at. The session view's title in the topbar takes the role the three destination pages already had.
- 9eff82e: Make the desktop shell's dev-server override actually work, and unbreak `vite dev`. `resolvePwaUrl` now accepts a `--pwa-url=<url>` argv flag (which `open --args` delivers) instead of relying only on `LOOMBOX_DESKTOP_PWA_URL`, which a LaunchServices-started app on macOS 26 never inherits from `launchctl setenv` — so `scripts/mac-desktop.sh`'s documented `PWA_URL=` override silently loaded production. Separately, `@xterm/xterm` is now SSR-bundled: as an external CommonJS dep its named `Terminal` import made `vite dev` 500 on every page.
- 604a6f4: Stop the New session dialog wiping what you type. Its reset effect called `resetForm()`, which reads the `providers` prop, and a Svelte 5 `$effect` tracks reads made inside the functions it calls — so the reset re-ran whenever `providers` changed identity, which `+page.svelte` does on every re-render (it derives the list from the polled target status). Measured against the deployed relay, a prompt typed into the open dialog was wiped within a second, repeatedly. The reset now fires on the closed-to-open transition instead, which also covers `open` being re-assigned the same `true`.
- 55161ed: Give `@loombox/providers-core` a browser-safe entry point (`@loombox/providers-core/browser`) and move `McpServerSecretMissingError` out of `client.ts` into `mcp-secret-grants.ts`, beside the logic that raises it. The barrel exports `AcpClient`/`PermissionQueue`/`ConfigOptionStore`, which extend Node's `EventEmitter`; `vite build` tree-shakes them away, but `vite dev` evaluates every module it serves, so the web app painted a healthy page and then died on hydration with `Cannot access "node:events.EventEmitter" in client code`. `apps/web` now imports the browser entry, and a test asserts nothing reachable from it imports a `node:` builtin.
